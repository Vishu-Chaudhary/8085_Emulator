#### Debugger
Program also has a debugger mode which you can select on the start of program.Currently it has following abilities:
<ul>
  <li>break or b <line Number>: it will set break point on the given line number .</li>
<li>run or r                : Run the program until it ends or breakoint is encountered.</li>
<li>step or s               : It will run the program one instruction at a time.</li>
<li>print or p              : It prints the value of register or memory location for ex p A will print the value of register A.
                              p x2500 will print the value at memory location x2500 if any.</li>
<li>quit or q               : quit the debugger</li>
<li>help                    : will show all the commands of debugger</li>
<li>print or p <address or Register> :The program will display contents of Registers A,B,C,D,E,H,L , flag Registers and used memory Locations only</li>
  </ul>
## How This Works
Emulator uses python-2 as a backend to perform all operations.
Registers as well as flags and memory is taken as ordered dictionary.
### To run program:
$ python emulator.py
