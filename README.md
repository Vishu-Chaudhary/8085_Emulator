run or r                : Run the program until it ends or breakoint is encountered.<br>
step or s               : It will run the program one instruction at a time.<br>
print or p              : It prints the value of register or memory location for ex p A will print the value of register A.<br>
                          p x2500 will print the value at memory location x2500 if any.<br>
quit or q               : quit the debugger<br>
help                    : will show all the commands of debugger<br>
print or p <address or Register> :The program will display contents of Registers A,B,C,D,E,H,L , flag Registers and used memory Locations only</pre>
## How This Works
Emulator uses python-2 as a backend to perform all operations.
Registers as well as flags and memory is taken as ordered dictionary.
### To run program:
$ python emulator.py
